### **1.4 Software Implementation and Testing**

*1.4.1 Programming Language Skills*

- **Concepts and characteristics of programming languages**: Programming languages are classified based on their level of abstraction from machine language (low-level, close to hardware) to high-level languages (more abstract, closer to human language). Each has its characteristics, such as syntax, semantics, and paradigms like structured, procedural, imperative, functional, or object-oriented【92†source】【93†source】【94†source】【95†source】.

*1.4.1.2 Coding Standards and Development Languages*

- **Coding rules**: Standards such as C/C++ coding standards from CMU, Java standards from Oracle, and MISRA C/C++ ensure consistency, maintainability, and reliability in programming.
- **Major programming languages**: Proficiency in languages such as C, C++, Java, and Python is crucial for various software development tasks【96†source】【97†source】.

*1.4.1.3 Web Application Technologies*

- **Front-end web development**: Involves HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, AJAX, REST, JSON for creating the user interface and user experience.
- **Back-end web development**: Involves server-side scripting and database management using technologies such as JSP, ASP, Python【98†source】【99†source】.

*1.4.2 Software Development Framework*

- **Software development frameworks**: Frameworks like the Spring framework for Java development, Android framework for mobile applications, and eGovernment Standard Framework (Korea) provide structured ways to build software applications.

*1.4.3 Integrated Development Environment (IDE)*

- **Components of IDE**: Includes a source code editor, build automation tools, and debugger. 
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: A practice that encourages developers to integrate their code into a shared repository frequently.
- **Software build and deployment**: Processes involved in compiling code into executable programs, packaging these programs, and deploying them to the production environment.

*1.4.4 Software Testing*

- **Testing concepts and processes**: Software testing is a process to evaluate the functionality of a software application to ensure it meets the specified requirements.
- **Test case design methods**: Includes specification-based (e.g., Equivalence partitioning, Boundary value analysis) and structure-based methods (e.g., Control flow testing).
- **White-box and black-box testing**: White-box testing involves looking inside the structure of the application, while black-box testing is based on testing software from the user's perspective without looking at the internal structure.

*1.4.5 Refactoring*

- **Concepts of refactoring**: Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior to improve its nonfunctional attributes.
- **Code smell**: An indicator of potential refactoring, pointing towards areas in the code that could be problematic and may need improvement.
- **Conducting refactoring**: Includes activities such as defining magic numbers, removing comments and duplicated code, and extracting methods to improve code readability and maintainability.

This reviewer is designed to be a concise reference for understanding the fundamental aspects of software implementation and testing. It covers the basic concepts and provides a direction for where to look for more detailed information and practice.
