### 1.6 Trends in Software Development

#### 1.6.1 Open Source Software
- **Concept**: Open source software (OSS) is characterized by its license, which allows users to freely access, modify, and distribute the source code. OSS fosters collaborative software development and is often developed in a public, collaborative manner【14†source】【15†source】.
  
- **Licenses**:
  - **GPL (General Public License)**: Requires derivatives of the code to be open source as well【11†source】.
  - **LGPL (Lesser General Public License)**: Allows linking to proprietary modules, offering more flexibility than GPL【11†source】.
  - **MPL (Mozilla Public License)**: Permits the combination of MPL-licensed code with proprietary code in larger works【11†source】.
  - **BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution)**: Offers minimal restrictions on future behavior, allowing for proprietary use of the code【83†source】.
  - **Apache**: Includes explicit patent grants and a patent retaliation clause, protecting against patent trolling【83†source】.

#### 1.6.2 Latest Trends in Software Development
- **Blockchain**: Beyond cryptocurrency, used in supply chain, accounting systems, intellectual property protection, and secure e-voting【25†source】.
- **Cloud Computing**: Facilitates collaboration, with increased use of cloud-native solutions for app development and remote work infrastructure【26†source】.
- **Python**: Has become a leading programming language, especially for AI and machine learning-based software solutions【27†source】.
- **TensorFlow & AI**: TensorFlow, an open-source AI framework, is significant for developing intelligent models and algorithms【28†source】.
- **IaC (Infrastructure as Code)**: Automates the management of computing resources, ensuring apps are deployed according to security standards【32†source】.
- **DevSecOps**: Integrates security practices into the development cycle from the start, evolving from the traditional DevOps practices【33†source】.
- **Outsourcing**: There's a significant growth in demand for outsourcing IT services, driven by cost efficiency and access to talent【34†source】.
- **LCNC (Low-Code/No-Code)**: Enables rapid development through graphical interfaces, allowing those with minimal coding skills to develop apps【35†source】.
- **PWAs (Progressive Web Applications)**: Cost-efficient and improve user engagement without the need for app store downloads【36†source】.
- **React Native**: Continues to be popular for hybrid app development, offering high performance and a near-native user experience【37†source】.
- **IoT (Internet of Things)**: Expanding in digital twin technology and edge computing, affecting various business sectors【38†source】.
- **IoB (Internet of Behavior)**: Collects "digital dust" to understand and predict human behavior, though it faces privacy legislation challenges【39†source】.
- **Web 3.0**: Involves AI, machine learning, cryptocurrencies, and aims to create a more autonomous and user-empowered internet【40†source】.

For the classes of the latest application development:

- **Microservice Architecture**: An approach where a single application is built as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms.
- **SPA (Single Page Application)**: Web applications that load a single HTML page and dynamically update that page as the user interacts with the app.
- **PaaS-based Software Development**: Platform as a Service (PaaS) provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app.
