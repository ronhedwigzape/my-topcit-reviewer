### 1.1 Understanding of Software

#### 1.1.1 Overview of Software Engineering
Software Engineering is defined as the process that involves designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It's an engineering discipline that applies engineering principles to software development, aiming to produce software that is reliable, efficient, and meets the requirements of users or businesses.

#### 1.1.2 Software Reuse
Software reuse is a strategy in software engineering where existing software is used in the development of new software. This can include the direct incorporation of an entire application system, component-based development, or developing application families. The goal is to improve the quality, efficiency, and maintainability of software projects by leveraging existing assets, thus reducing development costs and time.

Here are some key points to note:

- Software reuse is not just about reusing code; it can also mean reusing software design, patterns, user manuals, and more.
- Reuse can be as simple as copying and pasting code or as complex as integrating large systems.
- Component-based development is an aspect of software reuse that involves using self-contained components to build applications.

In terms of illustrations or images, diagrams such as UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams can be helpful in understanding software engineering concepts, while flowcharts or component diagrams can illustrate the concept of software reuse.
