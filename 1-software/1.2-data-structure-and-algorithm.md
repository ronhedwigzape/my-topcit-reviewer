### **1.2 Data Structure and Algorithm**

#### 1.2.1 Data Structures
Data structures are ways to store and organize data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently. They are not only used for organizing the data but also for processing, retrieving, and storing it.

##### 1.2.1.1 Able to explain the definition and types of data structure
###### 1.2.1.1.1 Definition of data structure
A data structure is a storage format chosen for efficient access to data, which includes a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

###### 1.2.1.1.2 Types of data structure: Linear, Non-linear
Data structures are categorized into linear and non-linear types. Linear structures include elements arranged in a sequential order, while non-linear structures have elements that are not arranged sequentially and can be connected to multiple elements.

##### 1.2.1.2 Able to use linear and non-linear data structures
###### 1.2.1.2.1 Linear data structures: List, Stack, Queue
Linear data structures like arrays, stacks, and queues store elements in a specific order that allows efficient access and modification. Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations, stacks follow Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order, and queues follow First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order.

###### 1.2.1.2.2 Non-linear data structures: Tree, Graph
Non-linear data structures such as trees and graphs allow elements to have multiple relationships with each other. Trees consist of nodes connected in a hierarchical manner, while graphs consist of nodes connected by edges without any hierarchy.

#### 1.2.2 Algorithms
Algorithms are sets of instructions for computers to perform specific tasks like sorting data, searching for information, and more. They are the steps necessary to produce a desired outcome.

##### 1.2.2.1 Able to understand the role of algorithms and select suitable algorithms for specific problems
###### 1.2.2.1.1 Roles and use of algorithms
Algorithms are crucial for performing calculations, processing data, and solving specific problems in computing. They put the 'science' in computer science by enabling problem-solving through precise steps.

###### 1.2.2.1.2 Classification of algorithms: Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithm
Algorithms are classified by the problems they solve, such as searching and sorting data, or by the strategies they use like dynamic programming and greedy methods.

##### 1.2.2.2 Can understand and use sorting & search algorithms
###### 1.2.2.2.1 Sorting algorithm
Sorting algorithms rearrange data into a specific order, such as numerical or lexicographical order, which is crucial for the efficiency of other algorithms.

###### 1.2.2.2.2 Search algorithm
Search algorithms locate or retrieve an element from a data structure and are classified into sequential or interval searches based on the search operation.

##### 1.2.2.3 Able to understand and apply problem-solving algorithms
###### 1.2.2.3.1 Problem-solving methods and algorithms
Problem-solving in computing often involves finding efficient algorithms tailored for specific areas within computer science, such as machine learning or cryptography.

###### 1.2.2.3.2 Greedy algorithm
Greedy algorithms make the optimal choice at each step, aiming to find the overall optimal way to solve the entire problem. They are used in optimization problems where the best possible solution is desired.

In preparing your cheatsheet, you might want to include visual representations like flowcharts for algorithms or diagrams showing the structure of data structures. While I can't provide images directly, these can often be found in computer science textbooks or educational websites.
