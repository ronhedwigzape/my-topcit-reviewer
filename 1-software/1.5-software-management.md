### **1.5 Software Management**

#### 1.5.1 Software Requirements Management
Requirements management involves gathering, analyzing, documenting, and maintaining software requirements. It's a process to ensure that deliverables meet stakeholder expectations and it's often divided into collection, analysis, and documentation phases【22†source】【23†source】【24†source】【25†source】.

##### 1.5.1.1 Concepts and Processes of Software Requirements Management
Requirements management and requirements engineering ensure that the organization understands and documents what the software should do, aligns software functionalities with business goals, and maintains this understanding throughout the project lifecycle【22†source】【25†source】.

##### 1.5.1.2 Management and Tracking of Requirement Changes
Changes in requirements are inevitable and must be systematically managed to minimize project disruption and maintain quality. This involves identifying, analyzing, tracking, and approving changes to requirements【29†source】【30†source】【31†source】.

###### 1.5.1.2.1 Requirements Change Management
Change management includes analyzing the effects of proposed changes (side and ripple effects), and making decisions via a change control board to manage these changes effectively【30†source】【31†source】.

###### 1.5.1.2.2 Requirements Traceability Management
Traceability refers to the ability to trace requirements through the forward (from requirements to deliverables) and backward (from deliverables to requirements) directions, often using a traceability matrix to record and track the requirements【32†source】.

#### 1.5.2 Software Configuration Management
Configuration management is about organizing and controlling the development process, ensuring that changes are made systematically and that the integrity of the current software state is maintained【36†source】【37†source】【38†source】【39†source】【40†source】.

##### 1.5.2.1 Concepts and Activities of Software Configuration Management
This includes managing changes to software artifacts, establishing baselines, and revision control. The activities ensure that the software development is organized and systematic, preventing chaos in the development process【36†source】【38†source】【39†source】.

###### 1.5.2.1.1 Concepts and Needs of SCM
SCM is needed to manage, organize, and control changes during the Software Development Life Cycle, which increases productivity and minimizes errors【36†source】【37†source】.

###### 1.5.2.1.2 Activities for SCM
Activities include configuration identification, control, status reporting, auditing, and handling the evolution of software configurations【40†source】.

###### 1.5.2.1.3 Baseline
Baselines are reference points in the software development life cycle such as Functional, Allocated, Design, Test, Product, and Operation baselines, marking the transition from one phase of development to the next【39†source】.

##### 1.5.2.2 Use of SCM Tools
Tools like SCCS, CVS, SVN, GIT, TFS, ClearCase, and RTC are used to manage configurations efficiently【36†source】.

#### 1.5.3 Software Maintenance
Software maintenance is the process of updating, refining, and patching software to fix bugs, improve performance, or adapt to new environments【44†source】【45†source】【48†source】.

##### 1.5.3.1 Concepts and Types of Software Maintenance
Maintenance is not just about fixing bugs; it includes enhancements and adaptations to meet evolving user needs or operating environments【44†source】【45†source】.

###### 1.5.3.1.1 Concepts and Needs for Maintenance
The need for maintenance arises from the requirement to correct faults, improve performance, and other attributes after delivery【45†source】.

###### 1.5.3.1.2 Types of Maintenance
The four types are corrective, adaptive, perfective, and preventive maintenance, each addressing different needs of the software life cycle【46†source】【47†source】.

##### 1.5.3.2 Software Maintenance Activities
These activities involve the actual tasks required to fix, update, and improve the software post-deployment to ensure its relevance and efficiency over time【48†source】.

This cheatsheet provides a structured outline of software management concepts and processes. Remember that each of these areas is deep and complex, and this overview should be supplemented with detailed study and real-world application for mastery.
