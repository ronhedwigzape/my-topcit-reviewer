### 4.1 Understanding of Information Security

#### 4.1.1 Concepts of Information Security

- **4.1.1.1 Able to explain concepts, goals, and importance of information security:**
  - **Integrity:** Ensuring information is accurate and unaltered.
  - **Availability:** Ensuring authorized access to information when needed.
  - **Confidentiality:** Ensuring that information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals or systems.

- **4.1.1.2 Able to explain terminologies of information protection:**
  - **Authentication:** Verifying the identity of a user or device.
  - **Non-repudiation:** Ensuring that a party cannot deny the authenticity of their signature on a document.
  - **Password:** A secret used to verify a user's identity.
  - **Digital Signature:** A cryptographic value that is attached to a message to ensure its origin and integrity.
  - **Hash Function:** A function that converts input into a fixed-size string, which acts as a fingerprint of the data.
  - **Key Sharing:** The exchange of encryption keys in a secure manner.
  - **Malicious Code:** Software designed to harm a system or data.
  - **Security Devices:** Hardware or software devices that enforce security policies.

#### 4.1.2 Basic Technologies for Information Security

- **4.1.2.1 Able to explain cryptography techniques:**
  - **Private Key Encryption:** A single key for encryption and decryption.
  - **Public Key Encryption:** A pair of keys, one public and one private, used for encryption and decryption.
  - **Block Ciphers:** Encrypts blocks of data with a fixed size.
  - **Stream Ciphers:** Encrypts data as a stream of bits or bytes.
  - **Hash Functions:** Used to verify data integrity, non-invertible.

- **4.1.2.2 Able to explain authentication techniques:**
  - **Types of Authentication:** Something you know, have, or are (knowledge, possession, biometrics).
  - **Digital Signature:** Provides assurance of the sender's identity and the integrity of the message.
  - **PKI:** A framework for creating a secure method for exchanging information based on public key cryptography.

- **4.1.2.3 Able to explain access control technologies:**
  - **Policy and Models of Access Control:** Rules that define how rights are granted.
  - **ACL:** A list specifying access rights to resources.
  - **CL:** A list specifying what objects a user or group can access.

#### 4.1.3 Latest Technologies of Information Security

- **4.1.3.1 Able to explain latest security threats:**
  - **Attack Techniques:** Methods used by attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.
  - **Security Vulnerability:** A weakness that can be exploited.
  - **Web Security:** Measures to protect web applications.

- **4.1.3.2 Able to explain latest security trends in IT area:**
  - **IoT Security:** Security measures for Internet of Things devices.
  - **Cloud Security:** Protecting data, applications, and infrastructure associated with cloud computing.
  - **Big Data Security:** Protecting large volumes of data from theft, leaks, or corruption.
  - **Mobile Security:** Protecting smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices.

#### 4.1.4 Organization and Standards of Security Management

- **4.1.4.1 Able to explain information protection management systems:**
  - **Concepts:** Frameworks designed to protect data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.
  - **Processes:** The procedures and activities designed to ensure information security.
  - **Measures:** Controls and safeguards to protect information.

- **4.1.4.2 Able to explain personal information protection policies:**
  - **Concepts and Terminologies:** Understanding of personal data and associated terms.
  - **Processing Procedures:** The steps required to handle personal information properly.
  - **Certification and Systems:** Recognition and systems in place for managing personal information.

- **4.1.4.3 Can explain the information & personal data privacy protection guidelines:**
  - **Information Protection Guidelines:** Best practices for securing information.
  - **Information Protection Management System Guidelines:** Standards for managing information security.
  - **Personal Information Protection Guidelines:** Best practices for handling personal data.

### Illustrations/Images

Providing illustrations or images would involve creating or sourcing visual aids that explain these concepts clearly. Here are some examples:

- **Diagrams of the CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) to visualize the primary goals of information security.


- **Flowcharts for Authentication Process** including password systems, two-factor authentication, and digital signatures.
- **Illustrations of Cryptographic Processes** such as how encryption/decryption works, what a hash function does, and how public and private keys are used.
- **Access Control Models** like diagrams of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Mandatory Access Control (MAC).
- **Infographics on Latest Threats and Trends** in IT security, displaying common vulnerabilities and methods to mitigate them.
- **Flowcharts for Information Protection Management Processes** showing the steps in creating and implementing security policies.
- **Checklists or Tables for Personal Information Protection Policies** outlining the steps and considerations for proper data management.

For detailed explanations, visual aids, and illustrations, further research and study of these topics are recommended.
