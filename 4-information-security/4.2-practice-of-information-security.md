### Lesson 4.2: Practice of Information Security

#### 4.2.1 Security of Application Software

**4.2.1.1 Secure Coding in Software Development Processes:**
- **Secure Software Development Life Cycle:** Implement security at every phase of the software development life cycle (SDLC), from requirements analysis to design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
- **Secure Security Design:** Establish a security-centric design that includes threat modeling, risk assessments, and adherence to security principles like least privilege and defense in depth.
- **Concepts of Secure Coding:** Understand and apply coding practices that prevent security vulnerabilities due to errors such as buffer overflows, injection flaws, and improper error handling.
- **Security Weakness Types:** Recognize and address various weakness types including race conditions, hard-coded credentials, and insecure data storage.

**4.2.1.1.3 Self-Diagnosis of Secure Coding:**
- Self-review code for potential security issues.
- Use automated tools for static and dynamic analysis.
- Regularly update skills to recognize new vulnerabilities and threats.

**4.2.1.2 Conduct Secure Coding:**
- **Java Secure Coding:** Follow best practices like input validation, error handling, and secure session management.
- **C Secure Coding:** Use secure functions, avoid dangerous functions (e.g., `strcpy`), and perform boundary checks.
- **Web Programming Secure Coding:** Secure against web-based threats like XSS, CSRF, and SQL injection.
- **Mobile Secure Coding:** Secure sensitive data on mobile devices, implement proper session handling, and protect against reverse engineering.

#### 4.2.2 Security of Data

**4.2.2.1 Database Security:**
- **Database Security Concepts:** Understand the importance of data integrity, confidentiality, and availability in databases.
- **Database Integrity and Audit:** Implement integrity controls and conduct regular audits to ensure data is accurate and unaltered.

**4.2.2.2 Access Control for Database Security:**
- **Database Access Control:** Enforce who can access what data under which circumstances.
- **User Authentication:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms for database access.

**4.2.2.3 Database Encryption:**
- **Subjects for Database Encryption:** Identify which data fields need encryption (e.g., personal identifiable information).
- **Database Encryption Concepts:** Understand the different modes of encryption, such as symmetric and asymmetric encryption.
- **Key Management:** Safeguard encryption keys using best practices like regular rotation and secure storage.

#### 4.2.3 Security of Systems Architecture

**4.2.3.1 Security Environment of Each OS:**
- **Windows System:** Implement features like Windows Defender, firewall settings, and user account control.
- **Unix/Linux Systems:** Use security modules like SELinux, perform regular patches, and configure user permissions.

**4.2.3.2 Software Development and Execution:**
- Develop and execute software in various environments ensuring security configurations are applied to the OS level.

**4.2.3.3 Network Security Environment:**
- **Network Attack Types:** Understand common network attacks and how to counter them (e.g., DDoS, man-in-the-middle attacks).
- **Network Security Vulnerabilities:** Identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in network configurations.

**4.2.3.4 Network Security Technique-Applied Software Development:**
- **Network Security Technologies:** Integrate technologies such as VPN, IPSec, SSL, and secure wireless protocols to protect data in transit.

### Illustrations/Images:
- For **Secure Software Development Life Cycle**, an image depicting the SDLC phases with security checkpoints would be helpful.
- An illustration showing a **threat model** could aid in understanding secure security design.
- A **secure coding checklist** or flowchart could be useful for self-diagnosis.
- Diagrams of **network security architectures** with VPNs, IPSec, SSL, etc., in action.
