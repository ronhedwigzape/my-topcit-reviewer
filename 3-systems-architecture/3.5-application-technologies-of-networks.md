### 3.5 Application Technologies of Networks

#### 3.5.1 Technologies of Application Layer

- **3.5.1.1 Application Layer Protocols**: These protocols include TELNET for remote access, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP for email services, FTP for file transfer, DNS for domain name resolution, and SNMP for network management.
  
  - *Remote Access*: TELNET enables users to access and manage devices remotely.
  - *Electronic Mail*: SMTP sends emails, POP3 receives and holds emails until the user downloads them, IMAP allows access and management of emails without downloading.
  - *File Transfer*: FTP is used for transferring files between systems.
  - *Domain Name System*: DNS translates domain names to IP addresses.
  - *Network Management System*: SNMP monitors network-attached devices.

- **3.5.1.1.2 P2P and BitTorrent**: Peer-to-peer networking allows direct data sharing between users. BitTorrent is a P2P file-sharing protocol that distributes file transfers across all users who are downloading or have downloaded the file.

- **3.5.1.1.3 Web Transfer Protocols**: HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the web, while HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP.

#### 3.5.1.2 P2P Networking and File Sharing

- Explains the decentralized nature of P2P where each party has the same capabilities and either party can initiate a communication session.

#### 3.5.1.3 Web Transfer Protocols

- Application of HTTP and HTTPS for secure web data transfer.

### 3.5.2 Mobile and Multimedia Communication Technologies

#### 3.5.2.1 Mobile Communication Protocols

- **3.5.2.1.1 Mobile Communication Technologies**: GSM, CDMA, WCDMA, LTE, and 5G are the backbone technologies enabling mobile communication, each with its own standards and protocols for voice and data transfer.

#### 3.5.2.2 Multimedia Network and Transfer Protocols

- **3.5.2.2.1 IMS Standards**: Details the specifications for multimedia and voice services over IP networks.

- **3.5.2.2.2 IMS Structure**: Outlines the components of the IMS such as HSS, P-CSCF, I-CSCF, S-CSCF, SLF, BGCF, MGCF, SGW, and MRFC.

- **3.5.2.2.3 Media Transfer Protocols**: RTP and RTCP are used for the delivery of audio and video over IP networks.

- **3.5.2.2.4 Internet Phone Protocol**: VoIP is the delivery of voice communications and multimedia sessions over IP networks.

- **3.5.2.2.5 Signal Protocols**: VoLTE is for voice calls over a 4G LTE network, SIP is for initiating interactive user sessions, and H.323 is for packet-based multimedia communications.

### 3.5.3 State-of-the-art Technologies

#### 3.5.3.1 IoT Network-based Technologies

- **3.5.3.1.1 Sensor and Device Technologies**: Involves technologies like OSHW, Beacon, Zigbee, Z-Wave, BLE, and protocols such as LoRa, LTE-m, MQTT, CoAP, XMPP, NB-IoT, Sig-Fox for IoT communications and interactions.

#### 3.5.3.2 Software-based Major Network Technologies

- **3.5.3.2.1 Software-based Networks**: SDN provides a method to manage network services through abstraction of lower-level functionality, and NFV decouples network functions from proprietary hardware appliances so they can run in software.

#### Illustrations
For the concepts mentioned, diagrams can be very helpful:

- **Application Layer Protocols**: A flowchart showing how an email is sent using SMTP and received using POP3 or IMAP.
- **P2P Networking**: A schematic showing a decentralized network where each node connects directly to the other.
- **Mobile Communication Technologies**: A comparison chart illustrating the evolution from GSM to 5G.
- **IMS Structure**: A block diagram showing the components of the IMS and how they interact.
- **IoT Technologies**: An infographic displaying various IoT devices and their communication protocols.

For detailed illustrations and images, it's recommended to consult textbooks, online tutorials, or other educational resources dedicated to networking technologies, as they will provide visual aids that are specifically tailored to these concepts.
