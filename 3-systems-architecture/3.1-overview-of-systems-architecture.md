### 3.1 Overview of Systems Architecture
#### 3.1.1 Concepts of Systems
##### 3.1.1.1 Concepts and Components of Systems
- **System hierarchy**: 
  - **Hardware**: Physical components of a computer system.
  - **Operating Systems**: Software providing the interface between hardware and user applications.
  - **Middleware**: Software that bridges the gap between OS and applications, including TP-monitors and Web Application Servers (WAS).
  - **Application Programs**: Software designed to carry out specific tasks for the user.

- **Server types**:
  - **Web Server**: Handles HTTP requests from clients, serving web content.
  - **Application Server**: Provides business logic for application programs.
  - **Database Server**: Provides database services and manages database resources.

##### 3.1.1.2 Concepts and Models of Networks, and Data Communication
- **Components and classification of networks**: 
  - **Network Topologies**: Bus, Star, Ring, Tree, Mesh.
  - **Network Types**: PAN, LAN, MAN, WAN.

- **Network models and standards**:
  - **OSI Model**: Standard reference model for communication protocols.
  - **Internet Model (TCP/IP)**: Foundation of the internet protocol suite.
  - **Standards Organizations**: IETF, ITU-T, IEEE, 3GPP.

- **Wired and wireless transmission technologies**:
  - **Modulation**: AM, FM.
  - **Conversions**: ADC.
  - **Coding**: Line Coding.
  - **Switching**: Circuit Switching, Packet Switching.
  - **Multiplexing/Demultiplexing**: Techniques to combine multiple signals.
  - **Access Methods**: TDM, FDM, FDMA, TDMA, CDMA, OFDMA.

#### 3.1.2 Concepts of Networks
- This would involve a deeper dive into networking principles, types of networks, and their specific roles in system architecture.

This high-level overview is meant to be a starting point for understanding the complex systems within IT architecture. Each bullet point encapsulates a broad concept that would be expanded upon with more detailed study. If you're looking for detailed explanations or visual aids on these topics, a thorough textbook or specialized course materials would be very beneficial.
