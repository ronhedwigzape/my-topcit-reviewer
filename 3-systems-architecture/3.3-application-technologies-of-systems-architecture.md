### 3.3.1 Construction Technologies of Information Systems

#### 3.3.1.1 Capacity Calculation
- **CPU Calculation Factors**: Transactions, application type, complexity.
- **Memory Capacity**: Based on processing needs.
- **Storage Devices**: Size and speed, IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second).
- **Network Capacity**: Bandwidth, latency, current infrastructure.

#### 3.3.1.2 System Structures Explanation
- **Web Servers**: Handle requests, deliver web content, support secure (HTTPS) connections, compress content.
- **Web Application Server (WAS)**: Manages web applications, balances loads, manages sessions, supports EJB.
- **Database Server**: Ensures data availability and manages databases efficiently.
- **Blade Server**: Contains multiple blade modules like operation blades and switch blades within a chassis.

#### 3.3.1.3 Latest Technologies and Trends
- **Converged Infrastructure**: Integration of compute, storage, and network with centralized management.

### 3.3.2 Technologies Dealing with System Faults

#### 3.3.2.1 HA/FT Technologies
- **High Availability (HA)**: Minimizes downtime, redundancy to counter single points of failure.
- **Fault Tolerance (FT)**: Ensures system operation despite failures, using techniques like TMR and RAID.

#### 3.3.2.2 DR Constructs and Application Technologies
- **Recovery Systems**: Technologies like DWDM and VTL for data recovery.
- **Recovery Levels**: Mirror (most immediate) to Cold (least immediate).
- **Recovery Metrics**: RPO, RTO, and recovery prioritization.

### 3.3.3 Cloud Computing Technologies

#### 3.3.3.1 Virtualization Technologies
- **Virtualization Types**: Application, network, server, storage, backup.
- **Server Virtualization**: Different hypervisor types and modes.
- **Desktop Virtualization**: SBC and VDI for remote desktops.

#### 3.3.3.2 Cloud Platforms and Systems
- **Cloud Platforms**: OpenStack, CloudStack, and others for cloud infrastructure management.
- **Container Technologies**: Docker and Kubernetes for application containerization.
- **Cloud Repositories**: Solutions like Swift and Ceph for data storage.

### 3.3.4 Big Data Systems

#### 3.3.4.1 Architecture and Technical Elements
- **Big Data Solutions**: HDFS, HBase, Hive, Spark, and others for managing and processing big data.
