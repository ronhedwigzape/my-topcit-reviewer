### 2.3 Database Programming

#### 2.3.1 Relational Operation (Relational Algebra)
- **Concepts of Relational Algebra**
  - A procedural query language consisting of a set of operations that take one or two relations as input and produce a new relation as their result.

- **Set Operations and Relational Operations**
  - **Set Operations**: Perform operations on sets of tuples.
    - **Union**: Combines tuples from two relations while removing duplicates.
    - **Intersection**: Retrieves tuples present in both relations.
    - **Difference**: Finds tuples in one relation but not in the other.
    - **Cartesian Product**: Combines tuples from two relations in all possible ways.
  - **Relational Operations**: Operate on the contents of database tables.
    - **Selection**: Retrieves tuples that satisfy a specified condition.
    - **Projection**: Retrieves specific columns from a relation.
    - **Join**: Combines tuples from different relations based on a related column.
    - **Division**: Identifies tuples in one relation that match all related tuples in another relation.

- **Extended Operations of Relational Algebra**
  - **Join Operations**: Advanced joins like outer and semi-joins.
  - **Extended Set Operations**: Additional operations like antijoin or outer union.

#### 2.3.2 Relational Database Language (SQL)
- **Use of DDL (Data Definition Language)**
  - **Statements**: CREATE to build, ALTER to modify, and DROP to remove database objects.

- **Use of DCL (Data Control Language)**
  - **Commands**: GRANT to give access privileges, REVOKE to remove them.

- **Basic Operations of DML (Data Manipulation Language)**
  - **SELECT**: Retrieve data from one or more tables.
  - **INSERT**: Add new rows to a table.
  - **UPDATE**: Modify existing data within a table.
  - **DELETE**: Remove rows from a table.

- **Group Functions of DML**
  - Functions like SUM (total sum), AVG (average value), COUNT (number of rows).

- **Advanced Join Operations of DML**
  - Efficient algorithms for joins: NESTED LOOP, HASH, SORT MERGE.

#### 2.3.3 Query Application of Database
- **Stored Procedures**
  - Bundles SQL statements that are executed as a unit.

- **Embedded SQL**
  - Incorporates SQL in a host language like C or Java.

- **Dynamic SQL**
  - SQL statements defined in string-type variables for dynamic execution.

- **Query Optimization by Phase**
  - **Characteristics**: Stages of optimization from parsing to execution.
  - **Transformers and Estimators**: Tools that modify and evaluate the query plan.

- **Features of the Optimizer by Type**
  - **Rule-Based Optimizer**: Uses heuristic rules to choose a query plan.
  - **Cost-Based Optimizer**: Considers various execution paths and their costs.

- **Interconnection Techniques of Web and Database**
  - **Server Scalability**: Indirect connections via middleware or APIs.
  - **Browser Scalability**: Direct connections facilitated by web technologies.
  - **Direct Interconnection Methods**: Using ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) and JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for database access from applications.

Visual aids such as flowcharts, diagrams, and tables can be particularly helpful for these topics. For example:

- A flowchart illustrating the steps in SQL query processing.
- Diagrams showing how different SQL commands modify the database schema.
- A table comparing the syntax and use cases for DDL, DML, and DCL commands.
- Diagrams that represent how JOIN operations bring together rows from different tables.
- A flowchart or sequence diagram showing how stored procedures are executed.
- Illustrations of different interconnection methods between web applications and databases.
