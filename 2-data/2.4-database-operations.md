### 2.4 Database Operation
#### 2.4.1 Concurrency Control
##### 2.4.1.1 Characteristics of Transactions
- **ACID characteristics**: 
  - **Atomicity**: Transactions are "all or nothing," so either all operations succeed or none do. 
  - **Consistency**: Transactions must leave the database in a consistent state.
  - **Isolation**: Transactions are executed in a way as if they are the only ones in the system.
  - **Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent.

##### 2.4.1.2 Commit and Rollback Operations
- **Commit**: Makes all changes from a transaction permanent.
- **Rollback**: Undoes all changes from a transaction, returning to the previous state. [22][23]

##### 2.4.1.3 Purpose and Techniques of Concurrency Controls
- **Purpose**: To ensure transactions are executed safely at the same time without data integrity issues.
- **Problems without control**: Lost updates, dirty reads, unrepeatable reads, inconsistencies, cascade rollbacks.
- **Techniques**: Locks, Optimistic/Validation-based, Timestamp-based [31][32]

##### 2.4.1.4 Two-phase Locking Technique
- **Expanding Phase**: Locks are acquired and not released.
- **Shrinking Phase**: Locks are released and not acquired.
- **Types of Locks**: Shared and Exclusive locks. [38][39]

##### 2.4.1.5 Deadlocks
- **Causes**: Mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, circular wait.
- **Solutions**: Deadlock avoidance, prevention, detection and recovery. [47][48]

##### 2.4.1.6 Isolation Levels of Transaction
- **Read Uncommitted**: Least strict, allows dirty reads.
- **Read Committed**: Permits reading only committed data.
- **Repeatable Read**: Ensures data read is not changed until the end of the transaction.
- **Serializable**: Most strict, transactions are isolated from one another.

### 2.4.2 Database Recovery
#### 2.4.2.1 Concepts and Types of Database Failure
- **Types of failure**: Transaction failure, media failure, system failure.

#### 2.4.2.2 Concepts and Methods of Database Recovery
- **Recovery principles**: Ensuring the durability and atomicity of transactions.
- **Techniques**: Log-based (Deferred and Immediate update), Checkpoint, Shadow paging.

#### 2.4.2.3 Recovery Techniques of Distributed Database
- **2-Phase Commit Protocol**: Ensures that either all nodes commit the transaction or none do.

#### 2.4.2.4 Database Backup Methods
- **Types**: Full, differential, incremental, archive log, hot, and cold backups.
