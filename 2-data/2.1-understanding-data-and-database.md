### 2.1 Understanding Data and Database

#### 2.1.1 Understanding Data
- **Concept and Features of Data, Information, and Knowledge**
  - **Data**: Raw, unprocessed facts.
  - **Information**: Processed data that's been organized or structured.
  - **Knowledge**: Applied information, used for decision-making and generalizations.

- **Data Processing Types**
  - **Batch Processing**: Collecting data and processing it in large batches at a later point.
  - **Online Processing**: Immediate processing of data as it is entered or received.
  - **Distributed Processing**: Processing data across multiple computers or locations.

#### 2.1.2 Understanding Database
- **File Processing Systems**
  - **Concepts**: Organizing and storing data in files.
  - **Features and Problems**: Data dependency, duplication issues, and integrity constraints.

- **Database Concept and Features**
  - **Concept**: A collection of integrated, stored, operational, and shared data.
  - **Features**: Real-time accessibility, continuous evolution, concurrent sharing, content reference.

#### 2.1.3 Understanding Database Systems
- **Database System Concept and Components**
  - **Definition**: A system to manage databases including DBMS, data, hardware, and users.
  - **Components**: Database, Database Management System (DBMS), Data processing language, Users.

- **3-Level Database Architecture (ANSI-SPARC)**
  - **Definition**: A framework for database abstraction layers: External, Conceptual, Internal.
  - **Background Idea**: To separate user applications from the physical database.

- **Data Independence**
  - **Background**: The need to modify the schema at one level without altering the other levels.
  - **Logical Independence**: Changing the conceptual schema without affecting external views.
  - **Physical Independence**: Changing the internal schema without affecting the conceptual schema.

- **Roles of DBA and DA**
  - **DBA (Database Administrator)**: Manages database construction, operation, design, and tuning.
  - **DA (Data Architect)**: Establishes data standards, modeling, and security systems.

- **DBMS Concepts and Functions**
  - **Definition**: Software for creating and managing databases.
  - **Functions**: Data storage, retrieval, update, and administration of databases.
  - **Components**: Query language processor, transaction manager, stored data manager, data catalog.

#### 2.1.4 Understanding Categories of Database
- **Data Model and Database Structure**
  - **Models**: Hierarchical, Network, Relational, Object-oriented, Object-relational.
  - **History and Application Areas**: Evolution of database models and their use cases.

- **Object-Relational Database (ORDB)**
  - **Concepts and Features**: A DB that integrates features of both object-oriented and relational DBs.

- **XML Documents**
  - **XML-based Data Definition**: Structures for defining data like XML Schema and DTD.
  - **XML Data Processing**: Technologies for working with XML, such as XPath, XQuery, and XLink.

- **Various Database Systems**
  - **Unstructured Database**: Databases for documents, multimedia, GIS, etc.
  - **Main Memory Database Management System (MMDBMS)**: Databases primarily stored in main memory.
  - **Row-oriented/Column-oriented DBMS**: Databases optimized for row or column storage.
  - **Embedded DBMS**: DBMS embedded within an application.
  - **Mobile DBMS**: DBMS for mobile environments.

For visual aids, consider creating diagrams or illustrations that depict the following:
- The transformation from data to information to knowledge (a pyramid structure works well).
- The flow of data in batch, online, and distributed processing.
- The architecture layers of the ANSI-SPARC model.
- A chart comparing the roles and responsibilities of DBAs and DAs.
- The components of a DBMS, possibly in a flowchart to show how they interact.
- A timeline or a progression chart of database model evolution.
- XML document structure, perhaps with an example of a simple XML code snippet.
- A schematic showing different types of database systems and their key characteristics.
