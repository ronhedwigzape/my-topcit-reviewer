### 2.2 Database Design

#### 2.2.1 Database Design and Building Procedure
- **Database Construction Procedure**: Steps to create a database, from initial analysis to final implementation.
- **Design Considerations**:
  - **Analysis Work Products**: Documentation of requirements and specifications.
  - **Principal Personnel**: Roles and responsibilities in the design team.
  - **Impact of Design**: How design choices affect functionality and performance.

#### 2.2.2 Data Modeling
- **Concepts of Data Modeling**: Understanding the abstraction of real-world entities into a database structure.
  - **Conceptual**: High-level, technology-agnostic organization of data.
  - **Logical**: Specific to the data model (e.g., relational), often includes normalization.
  - **Physical**: How the model will be implemented in a specific DBMS.
- **Design of Entities, Attributes, and Identifiers**: Tailoring the structure of the data to fulfill the requirements.
- **Design of Relationships**: Establishing connections between entities, considering various types of relationships like recursive and parallel.
- **Connection Trap Problems**: Addressing design issues like fan traps and chasm traps that can lead to incorrect queries.
- **ORM Conversion**: Methods to translate object-oriented models into relational tables.
- **ERD Notations**: Various ways to visually represent data models, like Chen's and Crow's Foot notations.
- **Extended ER Model**: Understanding advanced features like generalization/specialization.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensuring accuracy and consistency of data through various forms of integrity: domain, key, entity, referential, and user-defined.

#### 2.2.3 Key Attributes and Normalization
- **Functional Dependency and Inference Rules**: Foundations of relational database design, including Armstrong's axioms.
- **Normalization Anomalies**: Techniques to minimize redundancy and avoid update, delete, and insert anomalies through various normal forms.
- **Denormalization**: The process and techniques for strategically reducing normalization for performance benefits.
- **Performance Considerations**: How design affects database performance, including index optimization and handling of mass-data.

#### 2.2.4 Physical Design of Database
- **Transition to Relational Tables**: Converting conceptual and logical designs into physical table structures.
- **Design of Tables**: Crafting the DDL to define tables and their relationships.
- **Design of Data Types and Indexes**: Selecting appropriate types for data columns and designing indexes for query optimization.
- **Design of Database Views**: Creating views for data abstraction and security.
- **Distributed Database Design**: Principles for designing databases that are spread across multiple locations.

#### 2.2.5 Quality and Standardization
- **Data Quality**: Ensuring the data meets certain standards of accuracy, relevance, and timeliness.
- **Data Standardization**: Establishing and adhering to data standards for consistency and interoperability.

### Visual Aids for Database Design
For visual illustrations to accompany this cheatsheet, consider the following:
- Flowcharts or step-by-step diagrams for database construction and design procedures.
- Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) showcasing different notations.
- Examples of normalized tables for various normal forms.
- Diagrams illustrating functional dependencies and key integrity.
- Conceptual diagrams for data integrity constraints.
- Illustrations of common design patterns to avoid connection traps.
- Comparative diagrams for the transition from object-oriented models to relational tables.

These visual components will help to cement understanding of the database design process and the various considerations that need to be accounted for to create a robust, reliable, and efficient database system.
